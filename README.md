This repository contains the server side of my phase 3 project including the necessary ruby files that use ActiveRecord.

There are three models in this application, a "portfolio", "coins, and "users".  The portfolio model creates a relationship between the coins and users.

In this Single Page Application you can search through cryptocurrencies using the search bar at the top of the page and add whichever coins into your portfolio.

Once they are added you can input your purchase price to obtain the profit and loss based on the current prices of the corresponding cryptocurrency.

Also, you can remove any cryptocurrencies from your portfolio with the "remove" button. 

Thank you for your interest!

Matt
